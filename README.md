# Learn Python 🐍: The Laziest Method 💤

A minimalist, example-driven Python learning project for lazy developers.

## Why

- We know how to code (maybe...), We just need to learn Python's flavor.
- We don't want long theory, We want working code and quick explanations.

## Requirements

- Python 3+
- Just run the `.py` files
